Jira Client library 
======================

The project should provide small Jira client for a Dashboard. Of course the JIRA dashboard could be customized as well, but this is not that easy in our company.
Currently a web based dashboard with a single query for a specific user is available. Plan to have 2 or 3 queries on the main dashboard.

Maybe I can extend the functionality of the Silverlight client.
